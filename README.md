Jobify - Full Stack Job Management Application


Project Overview
This project is a key step in my journey to mastering full-stack development. I started by building and deploying a backend API using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, with full CRUD capabilities for job management.<br> Now, I'm integrating that backend with a frontend application to provide a complete user experience, showcasing both server-side and client-side development skills.<br>

My goal is to solidify my understanding of the full development cycle by working with real-world tools and technologies, handling everything from database management to API design, and building a responsive UI.<br> This project helps me connect the dots between backend and frontend development, bringing everything together in a live application.<br>


<br>
<br>
This project serves as a learning opportunity to understand the flow between frontend and backend development, API integration, and user authentication using JWT tokens.

<br>
<br>
Features
User Registration & Login: Users can sign up and log in using their email and password.<br>Authentication is handled with JWT (JSON Web Tokens).<br>

Job Management: Authenticated users can:
<br>
Create job listings
View all their jobs
Update job details
Delete jobs
<br>
API Integration: The frontend consumes the API built with Node.js and Express for managing jobs.<br>
Protected Routes: Certain routes are protected and only accessible to logged-in users.<br> If the token is absent or invalid, the user will be redirected to the login page.<br>
Responsive UI: Designed for ease of use across different devices.<br>

<br>
